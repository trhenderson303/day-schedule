## Description

This Day Scheduler App is perfect for keeping track of whatever commitments you may have throughout the work day. It uses the Day.js API to display the current time and to categorize the hours of the day as past, present or future, to dynamically color-coordinate. Users can click any hour and enter their notes, which will be stored and available after pressing the save button.
